# Week 4: Food Safety

## Prebiotics and Probiotics

### Probiotics

* **live bacterial culture** that may  be beneficial to your health

* Present in **or** added to foods

* Have to be consumed on a continuous basis because they are very quickly eliminated.

> **Notes on regulations**:
> 
> * Canadian regulations require specific name of probiotic listed as ingredient 
> 
> * Pemitted claims: nutrient-function claim about role of probiotics in health
> 
> * Content claim about calcium & vitamin D.

#### Roles of probiotics:

* Improve immune function.

* Prevent diarrhea.

* Modify colon cancer risk

* Affect body weight.

### Prebiotics

* **Indigestible carbohydrates**(not alive) in fruits and vegetables. 

* Added to foods in purified form

* Help support growth of beneficial microflora(i.e priobiotics eat prebiotics.)

### Intestinal microflora(microbiome) in the Large Intestine:

* **Slow movement of components** favors growth of bacteria

* Bacteria can break down indigestible food components such as dietary fibre.
  
  * Lead to fermentation, intestinal gas

## Breastfeeding and Infant Gastrointestinal System

### Colostrum:

* Breast milk produced during f**irst week after delivery**, with a different composition from mature breast milk.

* <mark>Contains **immune factors** to help protect the infant from infection, particularly in GI tract.</mark>

* <mark>Contains **antibodies** which pass from mother's bloodstream into the milk.</mark>

### General Breast Milk

> Note: enzymes break down food
> 
> * proteases break down proteins
> 
> * lipases break down fats
> 
> * amylases break down starch and sugar.

### Breastfeeding

* Infants have a **suckling reflex** for first **4-6 months**. That's why they're unable to consume **solid food** at the beginning.

> Note: until 6 months of age, Health Canada recommends infants are exclusively breastfed.
> 
> Breastfeeding is more common among:
> 
> * Mothers with partners
> 
> * Non-smoking mothers
> 
> * Women who give birth at home
> 
> * Non-working mothers

### Carbohydrates

* **Great PREbiotics** (promoting growth of Lactobacillus bifidus)
  
  * reduce risk of gastrointestinal infections in infant's gut.

* No starch in milk $\Rightarrow$ low amylase in infant gut

> amylase: enzyme which breaks down starches and sugars, and because there's no starch in milk, you don't need amylase.

* **lactase**(breaks down lactose) present in large amoutns in **brush border of instestinge**

### Fat

* **VERY HIGH in fat**(52%)
  
  * Supports rapid growth rate of newborns.

* **Gastric lipase**: plays important role in fat digestion in infants.

> Lipase: digests, transports and processes dietary lipids(triglycerides, fats, oils)

* Few pancreatic digestive enzymes in infants compared to adults.

### Protein

* **Proteins are absorbed broken down**(into amino acids) from adults.

* **Antibodies in breast milk are absorbed intact** and enhance the infant's immune system.

* Infants produce enzyme **rennin** to digest other proteins.

## Gastric Bypass Surgery

* Recommended to people with High Body Mass index, at risk for chronic disease(type 2 diabestes and cardiovascular disease), have been overweight for a long time.

### Advantages

* <font color="blue">Reduces size of stomach</font>

* <font color="blue">Shortens length of intestines, so less food is absorbed by the body(therefore less converted to fat)</font>

* **Therefore** Very effective for weight loss

### Disadvantages

* Because instestine is shortened, the areas where vitamins and minerals are usually abosrbed are now bypassed, so you need vitamins injections to prevent defficiencies.

* **Gastric dumping syndrome**:
  
  * food flow: stomach $\rightarrow$ small inestine (sphincter is bypassed).
  
  * If too much food enters the small intestine quickly, **water moves through osmosis from body into the lumen of the gut**, because the food is a high solute concentration(and in osmosis solvent molecules(water) move from low solute concentration to high solute concentration)  
  
  * Symptoms include: dizziness, nausea, diarrhea

## Foor-Borne Illness

### Food infection

* Ingestion of **living microbes(bacteria, viruses, parasites)**.
  * *Salmonella*: microbe in check and eggs. Destroyed by cooking thoroughly
  * *Listeria*: microbe in luncheon meats(because eaten without cooking). 
* Microwaving of raw chicken products not recommended, because heating is uneven

### Food intoxication

* Ingestion of **toxins secreted by microbes**. Can occur if all microbes are killed by heat treatment, if the toxin is heat-resistant.
* *E.coli*: in been and vegetables grown next to beef. Destroyed by cooking at high temperatures.
* *Staphylococcus aureus*: <mark>heat-resistant</mark>. Spread from humans via coughing and sneezing. Present in meat, potato & macaroni salads. <font color="red">Refrigeration limits bacteria growth</font>.

### General Advice

#### Temperatures

* Avoid unsave temperatures
  
  * 15-52 C: rapid bacterial growth and bacterial toxins. Food should be at this temperature for minimal amounts of time.
  
  * 4-15 C and 52-60 C: Some growth may occur. Many Bacteria survive. 

* Cook food at high temperatures(kills most of the bacteria). 75C is minimum temperature for reheating foods. Warming temperatures control growth but allow survival of some bacteria

* Keep food in cold temperatures. **4C-** Stops the growth of most bacteria.

#### Food Etiquette

* Don't cross-contaminate(raw meats with one knife, fish and shellfish with another knife, unwashed fruits and veggies with another)

* Wash hands and surfaces often
