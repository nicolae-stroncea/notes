# Week 5: Carbohydrates

## Chesmistry of Carbohydrates

### Summary of Structures

* Monosaccharides: simplest unit of carbohydrates

* Disaccharide: 2 monosaccharide

* Oligosaccharide: 3-10 monosaccharides

* Polysaccharides(10+) monosaccharides

### Monosaccharides

* **Simplest units of carbohydrates**(simple sugars)

* Cannot by hydrolyzed

* Examples: <font color="purple">**Glucose**, **Galactose**, **Fructose**</font>

### Disaccharides

* 2 <u>covalently bonded</u> monosaccharides

* Examples: <font color="purple">**Maltose**(2 glucose), **Sucrose**(1 glucose + 1 fructose), **Lactose**(1 galactose + 1 glucose)</font>

> * Condensation forms covalent bonds and hydrolysis breaks covalent bonds down.
> 
> **Condensation forms a covalent bond**, by releasing water(and that's why it's condensation, because you suddently have more water)
> 
> **Hydrolysis breaks down a covalent bond** between sugars, by adding water
> 
> *Covalent bond(molecular bond)*: chemical bond where atoms share electron pairs.

### Oligosaccharides

* <mark>Disaccharides contain 2 monosaccharide</mark>

* <mark>Oligosaccharides contain 3-10 monosaccharides</mark>(most often **beans**)

### Polysaccharides

* 11+ monosaccharides

* **Digestible(starches, amylose, amylpoectin)**
  
  * They are broken down by enzymes and absorbed

* **Indigestible(dietary fibre, resistant starch)**

### Examples of Polysaccharide

1. **Glycogen**: a form of polysaccharide produced by body and stored in the liver.
   
   * One of our best friend, nutritionally
   
   * When we consume carbohydrates, **body breaks them down and stores as glycogen**. Any time somebody needs sugar, body breaks down glycogen. 
   
   * **glycogen is produced by the body.** Our body can store up to 500g of glycogen(will get us through 24 hours if we're very sedentary)

2.  **Starches**: come from food and body can digest them. *Most carbohydrates in our diets are starches.* 
* **Amylopectin**: branched polysaccharide

* **Amylose**: linear polysaccharide
3.  **Fiber**: come from food and are **not digestible**.

#### Fiber(on the note of fiber, an important type of Polysaccharide)

* 2 categories:
  
  * **Dietary Fiber** (naturally found in foods: beans, fruits, etc). This is the main one.
  
  * **Functional Fiber** (added to foods, isolated from plant sources)
  
  Both types of fiber are a mixture of: soluble and insoluble fiber(does not dissolve in water)

* Dietary fibre is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Our body can break down fats, starches, **fiber isn't digested by the body**. <mark>It passes through the stomach, small intestine, and out of the body.</mark>
  
  **A high fiber diet:**
  
  * **Aids in achieving a healthy weight**. High fiber foods are more filling than low-fiber foods so you will eat less and stay satisfied longer.****
  
  * **Normalizes bowel movement and maintains bowel health.** Dietary fiber increases the weight and size of your stool and softens it. 
  
  * Lowers cholesterol levels and helps control blood sugar levels.
  
  **Best fiber sources:**
  
  * **Whole-grain products**
  
  * **Beans, peas and other legumes**
  
  * **Nuts and seeds**
  
  * Fruits and vegetables



> **Cellulose is a type of dietary fibre.** It looks like a long line of monosaccharides.
