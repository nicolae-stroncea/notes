# Week 4: Food Intake Assessment

## Most popular ways

1. 3-day food record

2. 24-hour recall

3. Food Frequency Questionnaire(FFQ)

## 24-hour recall

* Individuals asked about their food intakes.
  
  * Participant asked to **recall everything** consumed day(**type + quantity**) before the interview.
  
  * Interview can be on phone, in group setting, or in person.

* 4 parts:
  
  1. meal/time eaten
  
  2. Food name
  
  3. Method of preparation
  
  4. Amount

### Advantages

* Does not alter eating patterns(**3-day record may alter it cause you have to recall it**)

* **Most work done by the interviewer**, 3 day food record requires commitment from the participant.

### Disadvantages

* Relies on participants memory, Participant can forget certain foods.

* Provides information for only one day

## Food Frequency Questionnaire(FFQ)-> Survey

* Determines **food patterns over period of time**

* **Survey** can be completed with trained interviewer or independently(1hour or less)

* Props/**Photos used to estimate amount** consumed

### Advantages

* If FFQ is comprehensive(includes all foods with their portions), can **estimate nutrient intake**. <font color="red">It's a lot more reliable as relative measure of nutrient r food intake(comparing high vs low intakes).</font>

* Can be **validated by comparing with multiple 24-hour recalls**

### Disadvantages

* Relies on memory of participants

* Participants require higher degree of literacy than 24-hour recall(interviewer asks them question)

# Natural Health Products

* Try to achieve balance between tradition and scientific evidence
* Often don't include all ingredients.
* Fine for natural products: \$5,000. Fine for drugs: $5,000,000\$

### Tradition:

* In use for **> 50 years**

### Scientific Use

* Need scientific evidence of effectiveness(one RCT/few RCT's enough)
