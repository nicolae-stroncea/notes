# General Lessons

## Food Safety

### Food infection

- Ingestion of **living microbes(bacteria, viruses, parasites)**.
  - *Salmonella*: microbe in check and eggs. Destroyed by cooking thoroughly
  - *Listeria*: microbe in luncheon meats(because eaten without cooking).
- Microwaving of raw chicken products not recommended, because heating is uneven

### Food intoxication

- Ingestion of **toxins secreted by microbes**. Can occur if all microbes are killed by heat treatment, if the toxin is heat-resistant.
- *E.coli*: in been and vegetables grown next to beef. Destroyed by cooking at high temperatures.
- *Staphylococcus aureus*: heat-resistant. Spread from humans via coughing and sneezing. Present in meat, potato & macaroni salads. Refrigeration limits bacteria growth.

### General Advice

#### Temperatures

- Avoid unsave temperatures
  
  - 15-52 C: rapid bacterial growth and bacterial toxins. Food should be at this temperature for minimal amounts of time.
  
  - 4-15 C and 52-60 C: Some growth may occur. Many Bacteria survive.

- Cook food at high temperatures(kills most of the bacteria). 75C is minimum temperature for reheating foods. Warming temperatures control growth but allow survival of some bacteria

- Keep food in cold temperatures. **4C-** Stops the growth of most bacteria.

#### Food Etiquette

- Don't cross-contaminate(raw meats with one knife, fish and shellfish with another knife, unwashed fruits and veggies with another)

- Wash hands and surfaces often
