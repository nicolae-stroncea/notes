# Canada's Food Guide

## Controversies about Canada's Food Guide 2007

1. Not enough emphasis on whole grains

2. Food groups may be industry-influenced(Beef and dairy industry)

3. $Includes$ fruit juice

4. Emphasizes total fat intake instead of type of fat. Poor messaging on fat: types of fat(saturated vs unsaturated) are actually more important than total fat intake

5. Not enough emphasis on **whole grains**

6. Uses prescriptive serving sizes. Consumers prefer proportions instead of absolute amounts.

   * <mark>Foods that contain mostly unsaturated fats should replace foods that contain mostly saturated fats</mark>.
   * Water should be the beverage of choice. 
2. Processed or prepared foods and beverages contribute to **excess sodium**, **free sugars**, or **saturated fat** undermine healthy eating and should not be
   consumed regularly.
3. Food skills are needed to navigate the complex food environment and support
   healthy eating.
