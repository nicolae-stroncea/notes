## Studies

There are 2 types of studies: **Observational studies** and **Randomized controlled trials**.

> **Observational studies**(checks statistical significance in low exposure vs high exposure): Are the differences in disease outcome between *low and high exposure* statistically significant?
> 
> **Randomized Control trial**(checks statistical significance in control vs intervention): Are differences between *control group* and *treatment group* statistically significant?

### Observational studies/ Prospective Cohort studies

* Observational studies **do not** establish  causality

* They study <mark>**association**</mark> beteen *exposure* and *outcome*. Association can be: +ve, -ve.

* There can exist *confounding factors*(related to both the outcome and the exposure). If cancer cases are outcomes and the exposure is dietary outcome, we can also have exercise as a confoudning factor.

* We need to always correct for confounding factors, however we will still be left with residual confounding(uncorrected or unknown confounding).

* It's because of residual confounding, that we cannot establish causality. However, we can still establish association between exposure(high/low exposure to something) and outcomes. 

#### Advantages:

- Can measure hard disease outcomes if follow-up is long enough

#### Disadvantages:

- Show association but not causal links, between exposure and outcome

- Vulnerable to confounding & residual confounding

#### Measuring exposure: How to capture intake

1. Food frequency questionnaire(FFQ)

2. 3 or 7 day food records

3. 24-hour dietary recalls

4. Mobile devices, photography

5. Biomarkers of intake

### Randomized Controlled Trials(RCT)

#### Advantages

* Show causation

* Evidence is considered stronger than observational studies

#### Disadvantages

* **Difficult to sustain**, especially if it requires any big changes

* **Measures risk factors for disease rather than disease outcome.**

> Let's consider nutrition research

* We have a control group(typical diet population) and an intervention group(reserachers decide on changes in diet)
  
  * <font color="green">Control group gets dummy treatment in order so that both control group and intervention groups have equal levels of placebo.</font>

* **Assignment to control or treatment group is random**.
  
  * <font color="blue">Because the only difference btn control and treatment is the treatment of intervention(confounding factors are equally distributed between both gorups, since they're assigned randomly), we can establish a causal link between treatment and outcome can be established.</font>

#### Binding

* Double bind: Both participants and researcher don't know which group a participant is in

* Single bine: Participant **or** researcher don't know which group participant is in.

* Binding not always possible in diet study

#### Nutrition intervention

1. Nutrition education(you're taught frequently about health effects.)

2. Supplement(you're given a supplement)

3. Metabolic diet(you're given your meals)

## Statistical Concepts

1. **Hypothesis**
   
   * We have Null Hypothesis(no effect) and alternative hypothesis

2. **Probability or p-value**
   
   * determines probaiblity that an observed difference would occur assuming the null hypothesis is true(that there is no effect). Therefore, what's the chance of this occuring? "Given that our null hypothesis(base hypothesis: there is no difference) is true, what's the chance of this outcome happening?" If < 5% reject it.

3* **Relative risk**

* Use to determine risk between 2 groups(one with high exposure, annother one with low expsure), relative to one of them. If RR > 1, then risk is increased.

![relative risk](/home/nicolae/Winter/NFS284/notes/docs/relative_risk.png)

4. **Confidence Interval**(CI) for relative risk:
   
   * 95% confidence interval: There is a 95% chance that interval contains the "true" population value.95% CI indicates **statistical significance** and likely **range of risk** 
   
   * Assume High Intake Group: RR=1.5(95%CI:1.38-1.65). Statistically significant difference from reference group(RR=1) because interval doesn't include 1.

#### Evaluating observational studies.

![](/home/nicolae/Winter/NFS284/notes/docs/evaluating_studies.png)

* Outcomes: the things that are measured

* Comparison/Control: e.g low-fat diet, with nutritient education or 1-2 mediterranian diets.

### Systematic Review

* Summarize results of multiple studies on the same topic

* Meta-analysis is a "weighted average" of results of multiple studies

* Results are not considrered in the process, just that they meet certain criteria(population, exposure,outcome,etc)
